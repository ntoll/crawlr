Team 4 Notes:

Pass in the test.txt filename to use the custom map.

e.g.::

    $ python play.py test.txt

Team 5 Notes (Doesn't appear to work):

I had another dig around the code, and managed to get the second player 
sprite appearing.

Fixed some other stuff along the way:
* dodgy initialisations (calling __init__ twice, once on object 
creation, once explicitly)
* too many collections / groups objects, unnecessary
* some weird dead code
* the "left" bug that was crashing it now and then
* commented out BATTLE_EVENT processing, to make development nicer for now
* added a keypress "b" that writes some logging to console

The trick to making the second player appear, you will hardly believe, 
was hidden away in the Map.scroll() method, which contrary to what you 
might expect, actually moves the player into the visible part of the 
map. So I modified it to do this for ALL players (not just the main 
player). Also it seems only player.rect is actually used ..  player.x 
and player.y are just startup values and then get ignored (bad design).

Looked at lots of other things along the way, eg.  pygame.Sprite, 
pygame.Layer, dirty flag processing, etc.  So quite educational.

If we get the code from the other half of Group 5, then player 2 could 
actually move around .. maybe next dojo ..
(at the moment they get dragged around by the screen, it's not too bad)

ps. Python files attached, since I'm not sure of full git details,
you can git diff them or something.
